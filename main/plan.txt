Plan

Non scientists:
    -Dashboard
	-Search images by(2):
		-Species
		-Date/time
		-habitat
		-site
		-Favourate
		-etc. (see email from Penn and initial project pdf)
		
		
Scientists:
    -Dashboard
	-Shows results and download button(1)
	-For both searches downloadable csv file
	-Search by Animal)(1):
		-animal (species) (MULTIPLE)
		-user(s) (MULTIPLE)
		-gender
		-age
		-time period (down to seconds if possible)
		-site (preferably being able to define an arbitrary geographical area, or at least by sites defined in the database) (MULTIPLE)
		-sequence
		-habitat type (MULTIPLE)
		-presence of humans
		-blank images
		-number of classifications
		-whether the algorithm has produced a consensus classification or if the photo needs to be manually checked
	-Search by Location (1):
		-combination of arbitrary geographical area (NEED OT BE ABLE TO ADD MULTIPLE LOCATIONS)
		-users
		-time period during which photos were taken
		-species of animals spotted at the site (MULTIPLE SPECIES)
		-number of photos submitted
		-number of sequences submitted
		-habitat types (MULTIPLE HABBITATS)
		-presence of humans

-Dashboard:
    -Could be a tab on both Scientist and user pages?
    -Slideshow
    -Timeline (Uploads and classifications)
    -Stats (Not sure of what yey but make some up)
    -Graphs (chord diagram?)
    -Map
		
		
Taks (When you start working on one put your name by it):
	-Add uneveness as search criteria
    -Turn dropdown into SQL queries  - Tom White
    -Create basic pages and link together - Tom Wilshaw
    -DOCUMENT THE FUCK OUT OF IT ALL
    
    
    
More stuff:
    MAp of all sites -Tom White
    map sites used in returned results -Tom white
    timeline of uploads - will
    sample graphs -quentin
    finish site and user dropdowns
    pull together - Tom Wilshaw
    bug fix/check - all
    -DOCUMENT THE FUCK OUT OF IT ALL
