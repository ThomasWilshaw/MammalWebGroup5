'Making Memories' workshops are designed to appeal to all the senses. Delivered by dementia trained staff the emphasis is on fun.  

Each 'themed' session encourages partnership working and incorporates a range of activities from making bread to dressing up.

"You never know what to expect when you enter the room. It's always fun, we both get a lot out of it." - Brenda.
