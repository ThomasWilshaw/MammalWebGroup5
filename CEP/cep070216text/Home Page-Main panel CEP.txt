Welcome

We believe that creativity is fundamental to a fulfilled life and contributes towards good mental health. 

One in 3 people will experience poor mental health at some point in their lives.  We provide opportunities for people in need of support, to engage in creative activities which bring meaning and purpose to their lives.  

Our home is ‘The Open Art Surgery’ in Gilesgate, Durham. 
We deliver sessions for people who are experiencing poor mental health, particularly those who are suffering from depression or anxiety related disorders.
