Main Panel 
Our Arts for Wellbeing programme is a powerful 
alternative to clinical and pharmaceutical treatments. 
We know it works. We see first hand the life-changing 
impact our projects have upon people’s wellbeing.
 We believe that everyone can benefit from participation
in creative activities. Modern lifestyles are all too often made
up mostly of work and TV, leaving many people disconnected 
from thier creative selves.  Art should be part of a healthy lifestyle. 
We think of it as  ‘jogging for the mind’ 
Whether you have an interest in art or not you can benefit from our
‘Art for Wellbeing’ program.  You will get to try out new stuff and 
meet other people,, have a cuppa, a chat, and a giggle or two.

"I had never done any art before so I was very nervous at 
first, but now coming here is the high point of my week"
